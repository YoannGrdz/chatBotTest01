## Modules

### Chains
LangChain provides the Chain interface for complex applications that require chaining LLMs with each other or with other components. This interface simplifies and modularizes the implementation of complex applications.

#### Why do we need chains?
Chains allow the combination of multiple components to create a single, coherent application. They can be used to create complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.

#### Using LLMChain
The LLMChain is the most basic building block chain. It takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input, and returns the response from an LLM. 

#### Creating a simple chain
A simple chain can be created that takes user input, formats the prompt with it, and then sends it to the LLM.

#### Using multiple variables
If there are multiple variables, you can input them all at once using a dictionary.

#### Using a chat model in an LLMChain
A chat model can also be used in an LLMChain.
